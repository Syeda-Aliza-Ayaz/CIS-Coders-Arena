## 📋 About CIS Coders Arena

**CIS Coders Arena** is far more than a typical coding contest — it's a philosophy-driven learning experience.

This arena emphasizes:

- 🎯 **Integrity First** — honest problem-solving over quick shortcuts  
- 🕰️ **Consistency Over Speed** — regular practice beats cramming  
- 🧩 **Deep Understanding** — quality solutions over quantity  
- 🚀 **Personal Growth** — individual progress over competition  
- 🧘 **Mindful Learning** — staying focused on the journey, not just the destination

**Project Files:**
- `main.cpp` — main game loop and flow control
- `game.cpp` — modular game logic and player class
- `game_log.txt` — logs major in-game events (e.g., lives, coins, party members)
- `main.exe` — compiled executable (Windows)

- Dynamic state transitions (win/lose)

**Key Learnings:** Overcame challenges in modularizing game logic and ensuring consistent file I/O logging.

### **Round 2 Activity 7** ✅ *(Completed: July 13, 2025 04:50 PM)*

🟢 *Practiced randomization, file manipulation, and turn-based game design in Python and C++.*

**Projects:**

**Mad Libs Story Generator (Python)**

- Reads story templates from a file with placeholders (e.g., <noun>, <verb>)

- Asks the user for custom words and replaces them in the story

- Demonstrates text parsing, string manipulation, and file rewriting

**Dice Game with Turn-Based Mechanics (C++)**

- Simulates a dice-rolling game for 2–4 players

- Each player decides whether to continue rolling or stop and save points

- Rolling a 1 ends the turn with no points for that round

- Implements OOP using classes, private attributes, and static variables

- No winning condition allowed before Round 4 (increases fairness)

**Key Learnings:** Handled randomization edge cases and designed fair turn-based mechanics.

### **Round 2 Activity 8** ✅ *(Completed: July 16, 2025 10:10 PM)*

🟢 *Focused on typing accuracy, speed calculation, and number theory in Python.*

**Projects:**

**Speed Typing Test (Python)**

- Reads sentences from a text file and displays them randomly

- User types as many sentences as possible within 60 seconds

- Calculates WPM (Words Per Minute) and character-level accuracy

- Real-time countdown and user feedback using pyfiglet

**Digital Root Game (Python)**

- Asks the user to calculate digital roots of random 3-digit numbers

- Three rounds: each round gives a new number range (100–199, etc.)

- *Bonus:* Identify if the number is special (palindrome or sum=product)

- Demonstrates loops, conditionals, and math-based game logic

**Key Learnings:** Improved real-time user feedback and validated mathematical edge cases.

g++ -o substitution "Round 1 Activity 4\substitution.cpp"
./substitution "YTNSHKVEFXRBAUQZCLWDMIPGJO"
```

### For Python Programs

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
